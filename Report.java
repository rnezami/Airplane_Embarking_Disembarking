 This program is designed as a flight management system for an airline called "Nezami Airlines", focusing on
 passenger boarding processes, adjustments to the arrangement of seats as well as disembarking the plane.
 It is structured in a single class, "Airplane", and operates primarily through the "main" method.
 User interaction is handled through the “Scanner” object, which allows data input from the console.
 The main functionality of the program centers on the "TreeMap", which is used to store passenger names and
 their corresponding seat numbers as well as sorting them in ascending order.This choice of data structure organizes seat
 assignments efficiently, without using any collections interface.The flow of control in a program is managed by a
 "do while" loop, which ensures that  menu options are repeatedly presented to the user until they choose to exit the program.
 In this loop, the “switch” command manages the selection of different choices the user inputs, such as boarding passengers, changing
 seat allocation, and disembarking all passengers.Exception handling is built in to handle 'InputMismatchException', ensuring that
 the program remains stable in case the input type is incorrect. This is an important feature to maintain stability, especially in
 cases where non-integer input may be accidentally typed by the user. The program also includes two custom methods, 'myHeader'
 and 'myFooter', which are used to display header and footer with parametres to edit the lab and question. These methods enhance the
 readability and professional appearance of the program's output making it user-friendly. Overall, the program is well-structured
 and effectively fulfills its intended purpose, offering a simple yet functional simulation of an airline's passenger management
 process as well as providing a user-friendly code.
